# tinyworld2

LÃ–VE2D implementation of my old archived Flash game.

The original game was made for Ludum Dare #23, using Actionscript and Flashpunk library. You can show the old game source code on:

This new version try to keep the same ideas but adding a few improvements. I hope you enjoy the game the same I enjoyed creating it ;)
